,,,,Which of the following numbers is divisible by 7?,Medium,1112,1342,1435,1263,Option C,"Divisibility rule of 7:

Take the last digit of the number. Double it.
Subtract this doubled value from the remaining part of the number (the number without its last digit).
If the result is 0 or divisible by 7, then the original number is divisible by 7.
If it’s still large, repeat the process.

Let's apply this rule to the given numbers,  
Option-A: 1112  
Last digit: 2  
Remaining part: 111  
2 × 2 = 4  
111 - 4 = 107  
107 is not divisible by 7, so 1112 is not divisible by 7.  
  
Option-B: 1342  
Last digit: 2  
Remaining part: 134  
2 × 2 = 4  
134 - 4 = 130  
130 is not divisible by 7, so 1342 is not divisible by 7.  
  
Option-C: 1435  
Last digit: 5  
Remaining part: 143  
2 × 5 = 10  
143 - 10 = 133  
133 is divisible by 7, so 1435 is divisible by 7.  
  
Option-D: 1263  
Last digit: 3  
Remaining part: 126  
2 × 3 = 6  
126 - 6 = 120  
120 is not divisible by 7, so 1263 is not divisible by 7.  
Therefore, out of the given numbers, 1435 is the one that is divisible by 7."

$i^4$ = 1

After every four powers of i, the pattern repeats. So,

$i^{64} = i^{4 \times 16}$ = $(i^4)^{16} = 1^{16}$ = 1

Therefore, $i^{64} = 1$."
,,,,What is the value of ${i}^{48}$ + 1 ?,Medium,0,2,1,-1,Option B,"To find ${i}^{48}$  
Where i is the imaginary unit:  
We know that,  
  
$i^0 =1, i^1 = \sqrt{(-1)}$, ${i}^{2}$ = -1, ${i}^{3}$ = -i, ${i}^{4}$ = 1  
  
And the cycle repeats for every 4 powers:  
So, the powers of i form a mod 4 cycle.  
Now, divide the exponent by 4:  
  
48 ÷ 4 = 12 remainder 0  
  
So, ${i}^{48}$ = ${i}^{0}$ = 1  
${i}^{48}$ + 1

Hence, ${i}^{48}$ + 1 = 2"
,,,,"If $(-1)^{n} +(-1)^{4n}$ = 0, then n is ?",Hard,Any positive integer,Any odd natural number,Any negative integer,Any even natural number,Option B,"To find the value of ""n"" when $(-1)^{n} +(-1)^{4n}$ = 0, you can break it down and simplify it,  
$(-1)^{n}$ represents a sequence of alternating signs: 1, -1, 1, -1, ...  
$(-1)^{4n}$ represents a sequence where the exponent is always even, so its result is 1.
 
Now, you have the equation:  
$(-1)^{n}$ + 1 = 0  
$(-1)^{n}$ = -1
  
Now, if you think about the alternating sign pattern of $(-1)^{n}$, you'll notice that it becomes -1 when ""n"" is an odd positive integer, and it becomes 1 when ""n"" is an even positive integer.
  
So, for $(-1)^{n}$ to equal -1, ""n"" must be an odd positive integer.  
In summary, ""n"" is any odd natural number."

,,,,Find the units digit of $(11!)^{789}$,Medium,1,2,0,3,Option C,"To find the units digit of $(11!)^{789}$ 
We need to take the factorial of 11, raise it to the 789th power, and find the last digit (units digit) of that huge number.

Now,  
$11! = 11 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8 \times \cdots \times 2 \times 1$

That means $11!$ includes both 2 and 5 as factors.  
For example:  
5 and 10 → contribute factors of 5  
2, 4, 6, 8, 10 → contribute factors of 2

So, $11!$ definitely contains at least one factor of 10, and hence ends with 0.

Now, unit place of $(11!)^{789}$ means $0^{789}$

$0^{789} = 0$

Hence, the units digit of $(11!)^{789}$ is 0."

,,,,What is the last digit of $1234^{5678}$?,Hard,2,3,6,8,Option C,"To find the units digit (i.e., the last digit) of $1234^{5678}$  
We need to find the last digit of a huge number generated by raising 1234 to the 5678th power.

Now, we should consider the last digit of the base,   
Last digit of 1234 is 4

So, we are essentially finding the units digit of $4^{5678}$

Let’s observe the pattern of unit digits in powers of 4:

$4^2$ = 16 (last digit = 6)  
$4^3$ = 64 (last digit = 4)  
$4^4$ = 256 (last digit = 6)

So, the cycle of 4 is: (4, 6) — length = 2

Now, divide the exponent 5678 by the cycle length:

,,,,Determine the rightmost non zero digit of $650^{876}$.,Hard,2,3,7,5,Option D,"To find the rightmost non-zero digit of $650^{876}$.  
This is not the same as the units digit, because $650^{876}$ ends with several zeros due to factors of 10.  
We want the digit just before those trailing zeros.  
First, write 650 as a product of prime factors:  
  
$650 = 2 \times 5^2 \times 13$  
  
So, $650^{876} = (2 \times 5^2 \times 13)^{876} = 2^{876} \times 5^{1752} \times 13^{876}$  
  
Each pair of $2 \times 5$ contributes a factor of 10, which gives a trailing zero.  
The number of such pairs is $\min(876, 1752) = 876$  
  
That means $650^{876}$ ends in 876 zeros.  
  
To find the rightmost non-zero digit, we remove those zeros and focus on:  
  
$\dfrac{650^{876}}{10^{876}} = \dfrac{2^{876} \times 5^{1752} \times 13^{876}}{10^{876}} = \dfrac{(2 \times 5)^{876} \times 5^{876} \times 13^{876}}{10^{876}} = 5^{876} \times 13^{876}$  
  
Now we find the units digit of $13^{876}$.  
  
Observe the pattern of last digits of powers of 13:  
  
$13^1 = 13$ → last digit is 3  
$13^2 = 169$ → last digit is 9  
$13^3 = 2197$ → last digit is 7  
$13^4 = 28561$ → last digit is 1  
  
So the cycle is (3, 9, 7, 1), repeating every 4 powers.  
  
Now divide $876 \div 4 = 219$ remainder 0  
  
So, $13^{876}$ ends with the same digit as $13^4$, which is 1.  
  
Now multiply with $5^{876}$.  
  
$5^1 = 5$  
$5^2 = 25$  
$5^3 = 125$  
  
All powers of 5 (ignoring zeros) end in 5.  
  
So the last non-zero digit of $5^{876} \times 13^{876}$ is the same as that of $5 \times 1 = 5$  
  
Hence, the rightmost non-zero digit of $650^{876}$ is 5."

$4^5$ = 4  
  
So the cycle is 4, 1 and it repeats every 2 terms.  
  
Now divide the exponent 5 by the cycle length 2:

N = 35k + 5 for some integer k.

To find the remainder when N is divided by 28.

Now divide N by 28:

N ÷ 28 = (35k + 5) ÷ 28

Note that 35 ≡ 7 when divided by 28 (because 35 ÷ 28 leaves a remainder 7)
So:  
(35k + 5) ÷ 28 becomes  
(7k + 5) ÷ 28

We want to find the smallest value of N, so take k = 0 first:
Then N = 35(0) + 5 = 5  
5 ÷ 28 = remainder 5

Try k = 1 → N = 35(1) + 5 = 40 → 40 ÷ 28 = remainder 12  
k = 2 → N = 75 → remainder 19  
k = 3 → 110 → remainder 26

On every 4th day, C also works, so total = 5/36 + 1/24 = (10/72 + 3/72) = 13/72. 

Work done in 3 normal days = 3 × (5/36) = 15/36 = 5/12. 

Work done on the 4th day = 13/72. 

In 4 days, total = 5/12 + 13/72 = (30/72 + 13/72) = 43/72.

,,Do you remember which mathematical concept helps us find the least possible length that can measure multiple given lengths exactly?,"To find the least possible length that can measure multiple given lengths exactly, you need to look for their Lowest Common Multiple (LCM). The LCM gives the smallest unit that can evenly divide all the given lengths without leaving anything extra.

For example, if you have ropes of 4 m, 5 m 50 cm, and 7 m, you first convert them into the same unit (like centimeters) and then find their LCM. That result is the least length that can measure all of them exactly.

,,Do you recall how to solve problems involving remainder and divisibility rules?,"When solving remainder and divisibility problems, the key idea is to see what is left over after dividing a number. The remainder tells you how much the number “falls short” of being fully divisible. Divisibility rules are shortcuts that help you quickly check if a number is divisible by another without doing full division.

For example, if a number leaves remainder 3 when divided by 5, it means the number is always of the form 5k + 3. Using such forms helps to solve problems faster.

,,Do you know how to find the number of trailing zeroes in a factorial?,"To find the number of trailing zeroes in a factorial, you need to count how many times the number 10 is a factor in it. Since 10 is made of 2 and 5, and factorials always have more 2s than 5s, the count of 5s decides the number of zeros.

So, you keep dividing the number by 5, then 25, then 125, and so on, adding up the quotients. The total you get is the number of trailing zeroes.

For example, in 100!, the number of trailing zeroes is given by 100 ÷ 5 + 100 ÷ 25 = 20 + 4 = 24.

In short: Count how many 5s appear in the factorial - that’s the number of trailing zeroes.

Race length = 200 m.

Case 1: A gives B a 25 m head start.
B runs 200 − 25 = 175 m.
A runs 200 m and beats B by 10 s:
Time_B = Time_A + 10
=> 175 / vB = 200 / vA + 10. ...(1)

Case 2: A gives B a 45 m head start and they finish together (dead heat).
B runs 200 − 45 = 155 m.
So 200 / vA = 155 / vB => vB = (155/200) vA = (31/40) vA. ...(2)

Substitute (2) into (1):
175 / ((31/40) vA) = 200 / vA + 10
=> (175 × 40 / 31) × 1/vA = 200 / vA + 10
=> 7000/31 × 1/vA = 200 / vA + 10

Multiply by vA:
7000/31 = 200 + 10 vA
10 vA = 7000/31 − 200 = 800/31
vA = 80/31 m/s ≈ 2.580645 m/s

From (2): vB = (31/40) vA = (31/40) × (80/31) = 80/40 = 2 m/s.

Time for A to complete race = 200 / vA = 200 ÷ (80/31) = 200×31/80 = 77.5 seconds.

Example: “At least one head” when tossing 2 coins.

Total outcomes = {HH, HT, TH, TT}.

Favorable = {HH, HT, TH} = 3 outcomes.

Probability = 3/4.

2. At most → means maximum this much or less.

Example: “At most one head” when tossing 2 coins.

Favorable outcomes = {TT, HT, TH} = 3.

Probability = 3/4.

3. Applying with conditions (like multiples)

Example: A die rolled once, the probability of a multiple of 2 or 3.

Multiples of 2 or 3 = {2, 3, 4, 6}.
